            <h3>"ABOUT ME"</h3>
            <h3><small>Hello! My name is Lexter Caguimbal F, and I’m proud to be both a dedicated student and an enthusiastic basketball player. From a young age, I’ve been drawn to the game of basketball, not just for the thrill of competition, but for the lessons it teaches—teamwork, resilience, and strategic thinking. I’ve spent countless hours on the court, honing my skills, and striving to be the best player I can be. Whether it’s mastering a new move or leading my team through a tough game, basketball challenges me to push my limits and grow.

I believe that education is just as important as sports, and I work hard to excel in my academic pursuits. Balancing schoolwork and basketball has taught me valuable time management skills, discipline, and the importance of setting goals. I’m particularly interested in [mention any specific academic interests], and I enjoy finding connections between what I learn in the classroom and how I can apply it in real life.
                
                Being a student-athlete isn’t always easy, but I thrive on the challenge. My experiences in both academics and athletics have shaped me into a well-rounded individual who values hard work, perseverance, and continuous improvement. As I look toward the future, I’m excited to continue growing both on and off the court, with dreams of [mention any specific goals or aspirations, like playing basketball at a collegiate level, pursuing a certain career, etc.<h3></small>
